Tests for the sitemap expansion in audit.py.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A live run gets its page list from the site's own
sitemap, and that file is written by somebody else's CMS. The first
prospect scan, against a WordPress site with a Yoast sitemap index,
came back reporting three "pages": category-sitemap.xml,
page-sitemap.xml and post-sitemap.xml. A <urlset> lists pages and a
<sitemapindex> lists other sitemaps, both using the same <loc> tag, so
reading one as the other silently turns a scan of a client's site into
a scan of three XML files.

That bug is invisible in a well-behaved site's numbers. A plain urlset
scores the same either way, so nothing in a local audit would ever have
caught it. Only a strange sitemap shows it, and we cannot count on a
client to have one handy. It matters twice over here: Tri-County
Collision's live site IS WordPress, so until cutover every weekly run
is pointed at exactly the sitemap shape that caused the bug. So the
strange sitemaps live here, fabricated.

No network and no external packages: audit.load is swapped for a
dictionary lookup, so this runs offline in a second and cannot be
broken by a third party changing their site.
